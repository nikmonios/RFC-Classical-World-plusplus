		<English>[TAB]The first major written Arabic work was the Qur'an, the holy book of the Islamic faith. With the spread of Islam, Arabic became the written language of the conquered lands, and Arabic became a major world language. During and after this period, people of many different ethnic origins used Arabic as their literary language. The first major literature to be written in this language was in the form of poetry, specifically qasidas, epic poems originally performed orally and akin to sagas of the Norse lands. These began to be written down during the Umayyad dynasty (661-750 AD). With the rise of the Abbasid dynasty (750-1258), the qasidas were joined by general writings known as adab, a word that now means literature, but then meant refinement. Adab referred to prose writing that educated and refined readers by providing information about the world around them and included essays and book-length works on such topics as language and style, the history of other peoples and nations, scientific subjects, intellectual and philosophical questions and human nature. While the Dark Ages held Europe in its grip of fear, superstition and ignorance, the lands of the Muslim World continued on, having translated the most important works of Western science, and added to this stockpile their continuing pursuit of knowledge. These Arabic texts, some from Cordovan Spain, but many more from plunder during the Crusades, allowed Europe to regain many secrets that they had previously lost.</English>

		<English>[TAB]During the Middle Ages, archery in warfare was not as prevalent and dominant in Western Europe as popular myth dictates. Archers were quite often the lowest-paid soldiers in an army or were conscripted from the peasantry. This was due to the cheap nature of the bow and arrow, as compared to the expense needed to equip a professional man-at-arms with good armour and a sword. Professional archers required a lifetime of training and expensive bows to be effective, and were thus rare in Europe.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Medieval European knights attacked in several different ways, implementing shock tactics if possible, but always in formations of several knights, not individually. For defense and melee a formation of horsemen was as tight as possible next to each other in a line. This preventing their enemy from charging, and also from surrounding them individually. With their heavy and armoured chargers knights trampled through the enemy infantry. The most devastating charging method was to ride in a looser formation fast into attack. This attack was often protected by simultaneous or shortly preceding ranged attacks of archers or crossbowmen. The attack began from a distance of about 350 metres and took about 15-20 seconds to cross the contemporary long range weapon's effective distance. A most important element, and one not easily mastered, was to stay in one line with fixed spaces while accelerating and having the maximum speed at impact. Often knights would come in several waves, with the first being the best equipped and armored. The lance as primary weapon pierced the enemy. If an enemy soldier was hit in full gallop by a knight's lance embedded under the armpit, he was thrown backwards with such a momentum that he knocked over several of his compatriots. The heavy lances were dropped after the attack and the battle was continued with secondary weapons (sword, axe, mace or likewise).</English>

		<Spanish>[TAB]In religion and spirituality, a pilgrimage is a long journey or search of great moral significance. Sometimes, it is a journey to a sacred place or shrine of importance to a person's beliefs and faith. Members of every major religion participate in pilgrimages.

Since the bonds of kinship and local loyalty were more important to the average European than the bonds of nation-state, most medieval combat units were made up of people from one locality, under the command of a local noble. These local units were important to the areas they came from in that they could keep the incessant bandit raids that accompanied the collapse of the Empire, but could also be called up by a more powerful noble to operate in an army if one was needed. These units were trained in various combat maneuvers and operated with discipline that, while not up to Legionary standards, was still a far cry from the wild screaming charge that was the hallmark of ancient warfare in Europe, and the addition of heavy armor to common infantry troops, until this period unthinkable in Europe, was a dramatic leap forward for unit survivability. This step in military organization led to a non-noble warrior culture in Europe and paved the way for standing professional armies.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same space in sequential seasons to avoid the buildup of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one species is continuously cropped. Crop rotation also seeks to balance the fertility demands of various crops to avoid excessive depletion of soil nutrients. [PARAGRAPH:2]The ninth century saw the development of the three-field system of crop rotation: wheat or rye was planted in one field, the second field had a nitrogen-fixing crop (barley, oats, peas, or beans), and third was fallow. Compared to the earlier two-field system, a three-field system allowed for significantly more land to be put under cultivation. Even more important, the system allowed for two harvests a year, reducing the risk that a single crop failure would lead to famine. Three-field agriculture created a suplus of oats that could be used to feed horses. Because the system required a major rearrangement of real estate and the social order, it took until the 11th century before it came into general use.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Castles served many functions in medieval Europe; not only were they formidable defensive positions, but they served as administrative and judicial centers and as the seat of a lord's power. Since food and supplies could be stockpiled at castles, castles exerted strong influence over very large surrounding territories. Secular lords were not the only ones to build castles; religious officials often did so as well, to provide themselves with stronger power bases. Early castles were usually little more than wooden stockades constructed on dirt mounds and perhaps surrounded by a shallow trench; by the time of the reign of Edward the Confessor in 13th century England, castle-building had become a much more elaborate affair, with hundreds of laborers and specialists constructing huge stone fortresses with intricate defenses in carefully selected geographic locations.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Medieval Europe bred large horses specifically for war, called destriers. These horses were the ancestors of the great heavy horses of today, and their size was preferred not simply because of the weight of the armor, but also because a large horse provided more power for the knights lance. Weighing almost twice as much as a normal riding horse, the destrier was a powerful weapon in battle. [PARAGRAPH:2]On the other hand, during this same time, lighter horses were bred in northern Africa and the Middle East by Muslim warriors, who preferred a faster, more agile horse. The lighter horse suited the raids and battles of the Bedouins, allowing them to outmaneuver rather than overpower the enemy. When Muslim warriors and European knights collided in warfare, the heavy knights were frequently outmanuvered. The Europeans, however, soon made up for the lack of speed of their native breeds by adding hotter blood from captured oriental horses such as the Arabian, Barb to their stables. This cross-breeding led both to a nimbler war horse, such as today's Percheron, but also to created a type of horse known as a Courser, a predecessor to the Thoroughbred, which was used as a message horse.</English>

Viking longships developed from an alternate tradition of clinker-built hulls fastened with leather thongs. Sometime around the 12th century, northern European ships began to be built with a straight sternpost, enabling the mounting of a rudder, which was much more durable than a steering oar held over the side. Development in the Middle Ages favored "round ships", with a broad beam and heavily curved at both ends. The introduction of cannons onto ships encouraged the development of tumblehome, the inward slant of the abovewater hull, for additional stability, as well as techniques for strengthening the internal frame.

		<English>[TAB]By the early 14th century, the most effective armies were those consisting of professional, paid troops.

In practice, the feudal armies were often quite ineffective. For one thing, the feudal obligation had an escape clause whereby the knights could pay money ("scutage") instead of showing up when called. Moreover, many knights promised to pay and somehow never got around to it. Even the troops that did show up were usually quite eager to go home as soon as the 40 day obligation was up, or even earlier if they could get away with it. Since a campaign generally lasted longer than 40 days, this time limit could prove very inconvenient for the leader of the feudal host. The English had, by this time, done away with the traditional feudal system and replaced it by one where the feudal lords were still obliged to supply troops, but they would be paid and would stay in service for as long as the king could meet the payroll.

It was invented in Europe some time in the mid 1400s, although the idea of the serpentine appears some 40 years previously in an Austrian manuscript. The first dated illustration of a matchlock mechanism dates to 1475, and by the 1500s they were universally used. [PARAGRAPH:2]A further development of flash pan technology, the classic European matchlock gun held a burning slow match in a clamp at the end of a small curved lever known as the serpentine. Upon pulling a second lever (or in later models a trigger) protruding from the bottom of the gun and connected to the serpentine, the clamp dropped down, lowering the burning match into the flash pan and igniting the priming powder. The flash from the primer travelled through the touch hole igniting the main charge of propellant in the gun barrel. This design removed the need to lower a lighted match into the flashpan by hand and made it possible to have both hands free to keep a firm grip on the weapon at the moment of firing, and to keep both eyes on the target. [PARAGRAPH:2]An inherent weakness of the matchlock was the necessity of keeping the match constantly lit. Being the sole source of ignition for the powder, if the match was not lit when the gun needed to be fired, the mechanism was useless, and the weapon became little more than an expensive club. This was chiefly a problem in wet weather, when damp match cord was difficult to light and to keep burning. Another drawback was the burning match itself. At night, the match would glow in the darkness, potentially giving away the carrier's position. The distinctive smell of burning match-cord was also a give away of a musketeer's position. It was also quite dangerous when a group of men were speedily handling large quantities of gunpowder along with lighted matches. This was one reason why soldiers in charge of transporting and guarding gunpowder were amongst the first to be issued self-igniting guns like the wheellock and snaphance.</English>

		<English>[TAB]In the early days of seafaring, sailors operated solely through a process known as "piloting", in which the position and course of the ship was determined by referring to geographical landmarks. The need to stay in view of the shore severely limited the extent of sea voyages. Through experience, sailors learned to apply the science of astronomy to their profession, noting the positions and movement of particular stars. They realized that even when the shore was out of sight, they could steer by certain reliable stars.

		<English>[TAB]The Age of Discovery or Age of Exploration was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and spices. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. Among the most famous explorers of the period were Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Pedro Alvares Cabral, John Cabot, Yermak, Juan Ponce de Leon, Juan Sebastian Elcano, Bartholomew Dias, Ferdinand Magellan, Willem Barentsz, Abel Tasman, Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain, Willem Jansz and Captain James Cook. [PARAGRAPH:2]The Age of Exploration was rooted in new technologies and ideas growing out of the Renaissance. These included advances in cartography, navigation, firepower and shipbuilding. Many people wanted to find a route to Asia through the west of Europe. The most important development was the invention of first the carrack and then caravel in Iberia. These vessels evolved from medieval European designs with a fruitful combination of Mediterranean and North Sea innovations and the addition of some Arabic elements. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm Mediterranean and sail safely on the open Atlantic.</English>
